The following strategies are used.\r\n\r\n### Movement\r\nWrathOfPele attempts to move in arcs to make it harder for enemy robots to track it. The movement is mostly randomized and almost completely reactive. WrathOfPele avoids walls by firing a custom event when it too close to wall. WrathOfPele avoids getting hit by bullets by attempting to determine when an enemy robot has fired upon it. WrathOfPele will square off against the enemy robot and then switch directions when it sees an energy drop in the enemy robot.  \r\n\r\n### Targeting\r\nWhen WrathOfPele is not tracking an enemy robot, it spins its radar and locks onto a target. WrathOfPele uses narrow bean targeting in which every scan event focuses the radar directly on an enemy.\r\n\r\n### Firing\r\nWhile WrathOfPele is targeting an enemy robot, any time WrathOfPele scans an enemy robot, it points its cannon at the robot and fires at the robot using a fire power proportional to the distance of the enemy the robot from WrathOfPele.\r\n\r\n### Vulnerabilities\r\nWrathOfPele is mainly vulnerable against robots who are far away from WrathOfPele. WrathOfPele does not use any type of predictive targeting, this if a robot is far away, WrathOfPele's bullets may likely miss the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible for WrathOfPele to get stuck in corners due to the way the wall avoidance is built in. That is, if WrathOfPele finds itself too close to a wall, it tries to switch directions to move away from a wall. If this takes place in a corner, it's possible for WrathOfPele to oscillate between the two walls of the corner.\r\n\r\n## More Information\r\n* User Guide\r\n* Developer Guide\r\n* Contact Us","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
